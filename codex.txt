Could you clarify what you mean by “link the pinball machine”? Here are a few possibilities:

Are you asking for instructions on how to connect a pinball machine to a network or multiplayer system?
Are you looking for a website link or online listing for a specific pinball machine?
Or do you want to know how to integrate a digital pinball machine with an app or gaming platform?

Once I know which one you mean, I can provide detailed instructions or the appropriate link.

Could you clarify which document or information you are referring to from your tax file created with Copilot? Once I know the specific type of document or detail you want to generate—such as a tax summary, expense report, income statement, or deduction list—I can create the structure and you can provide the rest of the details from your file.

Here’s an idea for something you could create with a file called codex.txt:

Interactive Lore Codex Project
Concept: Turn codex.txt into a structured collection of fictional lore entries, like a digital bestiary or archive of a fantasy world.
Structure:
Entry title (creature, location, artifact)
Description
History or origin
Special abilities or lore notes
Usage:
Could be imported into a web app or game for reference.
Add hyperlinks between entries for an interactive wiki feel.
Expansion:
Include secret entries that unlock based on conditions in your game or story.
Add timestamps or author notes for a found-document storytelling approach.

This transforms a simple text file into an evolving digital codex or knowledge archive.
